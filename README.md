# obs_autobuild_test
Test to see how you make OpenSUSE build services build automagically

Information I found sofar
=========================
* http://openbuildservice.org/2013/11/22/Source-Update-Via_Token/ - Very sketchy and incomplete
* http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html - Not very usefull almost internal developer style documentation
* https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Concept_SourceService - Pretty decent docs. Managed to trigger a build that grabs the software from scm, but then I got stuck

Steps I took
============
* Created and empty repo [https://github.com/seccubus/obs_autobuild_test]
